Comprehensive Crew Management System: Project Status Update

Objective:
To create a comprehensive, cloud-based software tool for a manning agency to efficiently manage crew members supplied to various principals (ship owners/operators). The system aims to handle detailed personnel records, certification management, vessel crew distribution, and personnel-related financials, with advanced notifications, secure admin/user roles, and a modern, user-friendly interface.

Core Users:

Manning Agency Staff: Managers, administrative personnel (with varying access levels).

Crew Members: Seafarers themselves (for viewing personal profiles/documents).

I. Implemented Features & Functionality:

The core web application, deployed on Render.com, has seen significant development and now includes robust functionality across several modules:

Core Django Setup & Deployment:

Basic Django project and app structure (cms_project, crew_management, users).

Database configuration (SQLite for local development, PostgreSQL for Render.com).

Successful deployment on Render.com with continuous integration from GitHub.

settings.py is configured to dynamically handle environment-specific settings (DEBUG mode, ALLOWED_HOSTS, static/media file paths) for both local development and Render.com.

User Authentication & Authorization:

Custom login and logout pages are fully functional.

Role-Based Access Control is implemented:

Admin/Staff Users: Have full access to all management functionalities (CRUD operations across all modules).

Crew Members: Upon login, are redirected to their own profile. They can only view/edit their own linked data and are restricted from accessing other staff-only sections.

Robust handling of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for all form submissions.

Global Branding & User Interface (UI):

Consistent Corporate Branding: Every page (Dashboard, Lists, Forms, Details) now features:
